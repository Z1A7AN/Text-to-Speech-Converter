# Text-to-Speech-Converter-in-HTML-CSS-JavaScript
I have done a project that converts any text into speech and it was an interesting and skill-pushing project while learning HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript

To create a Text-to-Speech Converter using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, follow:

Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js
